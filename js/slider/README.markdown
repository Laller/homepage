## Changelog

(Only the most recent changes are shown below, see the [wiki page](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/wiki/Change-Log) for a complete listing)

### Version 2.3.1 (10/9/2012)

* MovingBoxes will no longer start on the first cloned panel when the `wrap` option is set to `true`. Fixes [issue #97](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/97).

### Version 2.3 (9/18/2012)

* Added a method to check when all images have loaded, then reevaluate the height of each panel.
  * The plugin that was incorporated is called [imagesLoaded](https://github.com/Mottie/imagesLoaded).
  * This entailed rewritting and fixing the plugin initialization function ([issue #92](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/92) and initAnimation problems ([issue #79](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/79)).
  * I hope this also includes fixing whatever is going on in [issue #62](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/62).
* Added a `delayBeforeAnimate` option:
  * The `beforeAnimation` event will be fired, then the animation will be delayed by the value in `delayBeforeAnimate` in milliseconds.
  * See [issue #80](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/80) on how this could be useful :). Thanks to [Alfazo](https://github.com/Alfazo) for the suggestion.
* Modified the layout so that the UL now gets the margin to center the panels within the frame instead of the first LI. This fixes the animation jump seen when switching from the second to first panel.
* Removed byte order mark (BOM) from the js files. Fix for [issue #94](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/94).

### Version 2.2.16 (8/17/2012)

* Added new styling to the demo pages (Chris)
* Updated to jQuery v1.8
* Included padding and margins in the panel position calculation to better center them.

### Moved repo to CSS-Tricks (8/15/2012)

* Sorry for the inconvience, but we've moved the MovingBoxes repository from chriscoyier's account over to the CSS-Tricks organization's account.
* Changed all links to point to the correct repository.
* If you run into a jsFiddle demo that doesn't work, just update the resources links; but please don't link directly to these files from your site, use these files for demo purposes only.

### Version 2.2.15 (4/23/2012)

* The `initAnimation` option should again prevent the initial animation. Fix for [issue #79](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/79).

### Version 2.2.14 (3/22/2012)

* Modified `hashTags` option and internal change function to now accept jquery id or class selectors:
  * Call it as follows: `$('#slider').data('movingBoxes').change('#astronaut');`
  * Link to main demo slide: [http://css-tricks.github.com/MovingBoxes/index.html#astronaut](index.html#astronaut).
  * On page load, hash tags will now set the initial slide and ignore the `hashTag` option setting. Previously it would ignore all hash tags if the option was `false`.
* Animation stops have been modified to now complete the animation instead of jumping to the end. This will smooth out the animation and resolve [issue #73](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/73).

### Version 2.2.13 (3/2/2012)

* Added `stopAnimation` option.
 * If false, movingBoxes will continue to behave as it always has. Any attempt to navigation using arrows or the navigation panel will be ignored until the animation has completed.
 * When true, movingBoxes will force the animation to complete immediately, if the user selects the next panel.
 * This will speed up the animation between panels, but the slider will jump to the next slide instead of smoothly animating.
 * Setting this to true appears to work nicely when adding [navigation using a mousewheel](http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/acV4n/749/).

### Version 2.2.12 (3/2/2012)

* Added callbacks to the `goForward()` and `goBack()` internal functions. Previously only the `change()` function had a callback option. Use it as follows:

    ```javascript
    var mb = $('#slider').data('movingBoxes');

    // change needs a panel number: mb.change(2, callback);

    // mb.goForward(callback) or mb.goBack(callback)
    mb.goForward(function(){
       // do something after MovingBoxes has finished the animation
    });
    ```

* Modified the internal `change` function:
 * Multiple calls to it in rapid succession will no longer break the appearance of the slider.
 * Changed to make this [mousewheel demo](http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/acV4n/744/) would work properly.
 * In response to [issue #71](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/71).

### Version 2.2.11 (2/28/2012)

* Fixed cloned panels getting labeled with the "current" class. This will fix [issue #67](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/67).

### Version 2.2.10 (2/28/2012)

* Fixed navFormatter
 * I copied the code from AnythingSlider which has its option named "navigationFormatter", not "navFormatter". That'll teach me for not testing!
 * Fixed the index since it was sending the navFormatter a zero-based index instead of the expected one-based index.

### Version 2.2.9 (2/27/2012)

* Added `preinit` callback/event
  * This event is triggered after the basic MovingBoxes structure has been established
  * It occurs before the `initialized` event.
  * Using this event allow for modifying the struction without any initialization delay.
  * See [issue #68](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/68) on how use this event to add inline navigation arrows.
* Modified the navigationFormatter option:
  * Navigation links are now wrapped by a span with a class of "mb-links".
  * The contents within the wrapper are removed and updated every time MovingBoxes gets updated.
  * The wrapper was added to allow prepending and appending navigation arrows, see [issue #68](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/68).
  * You can now apply attributes directly to the navigation link as well as modifying the contents; this allows for adding tooltip titles or other data attributes.
  * Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/wiki/Usage) for more details.

### Version 2.2.8 (2/22/2012)

* Clicking on side panels should not follow the link. A better fix for [issue #67](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/67).

### Version 2.2.7 (2/21/2012)

* Clicking on the side panels that are completely wrapped in a link should no longer open that link. Attempt to fix [issue #67](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/67).

### Version 2.2.6 (2/21/2012)

* Clicking on panels to switch will now trigger callbacks. Fix for [issue #66](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/MovingBoxes/issues/66).

### Version 2.2.5 (1/13/2012)

* Fixed a problem with multiple initializations.
* Remove the name attribute from inputs in cloned panels.
